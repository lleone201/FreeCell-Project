This FreeCell Solitaire implementaion was created by Logan Leone and Javier Roque. 
Instructions are the normal FreeCell instructions and there is a help button in the GUI that will bring you to a web page with the instructions on how to play FreeCell.
The interface is very simple to use. You drag the cards to a location and if that location is acceptable it will stay there and if not it will move back to it's original position.
The buttons are also very self explanatory, Help for help, and New game to start a new game.
Program can be run by typing java -jar hwx.jar.
No extra features were really implemented unless you count the fact that the card with move around the screen with your mouse while you drag it, that took some doing.
The Deck and Card classes were implemented by Logan. Javier implemented the CardStack class and then we both worked on the FreeCellGUI class together while talking on discord. As you can tell from the amount code, a large majority of the time was spent on the FreeCellGUI class.
